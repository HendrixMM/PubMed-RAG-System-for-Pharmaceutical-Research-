# Security Policy

This page summarizes the repository's security and responsible disclosure process. The full, canonical policy still lives at [`SECURITY.md`](https://github.com/hendrixmm/RAG-Template-for-NVIDIA-nemoretriever/blob/main/SECURITY.md) in the repository root.

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

- Email: security@pharma-rag.example.com (or the contact listed in the root policy)
- GitHub: open a security advisory or contact maintainers directly (no public issues)

## Expectations

- Never share API keys, PHI, or regulated data in issues or pull requests.
- Rotate NVIDIA, PubMed, and Apify credentials immediately after any suspected exposure.
- Follow the documented incident response steps for Sev 1/Sev 2 events.
